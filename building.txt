Building CDP.

This assumes general familiarity with the command line, and with 
standard build tools. 

All platforms: the CDP programs use the CMake system for building makefiles:
https://cmake.org/install/

Windows: the Windows version of CMake is required: this includes the 
 required Generator to create MinGW Makefiles.
It is included in a full installation of Visual Studio. 
Otherwise, it is available from the main cmake site: https://cmake.org/download/.

Mac users may prefer to use homebrew. Once installed, use:
brew install cmake


Windows:  install the Msys/MinGW linux-like environment.
   see: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwbundle/
   
 You will also need the Directx9 SDK dx9mgw.zip for MinGW, provided in the /externals directory.
 (from https://download.tuxfamily.org/allegro/)
 
 Currently we only build 32bit CDP binaries, under this older version of MinGW.
  
 Git: this is not needed simply to build the programs, 
 but recommended if you want to pick up updates, bugfixes, etc, easily:
 https://gitforwindows.org/
 
 
 
MacOS:    install Xcode along with the command line tools. This should also install Git.
               Otherwise, see: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
           install CMake (see above).
 
Linux:     we assume everything you need is already present!



Currently, one or two third-party libraries need to be built 
before commencing the main CDP build.

1: aaiolib (Linux and MacOS):  emulation of Windows keyboard functions (getch etc)
    unpack, then ./configure; sudo make install


2: portaudio (for the CDP play/record programs: paplay, pvplay, recsf, listaudevs).

   NB: for Windows ASIO support, the Steinberg dev tools ASIOSDK2 is also needed.

    see the applicable "pa...build.txt" under the externals directory.
            
             
To Build the CDP programs
  
   The canonical approach with CMake is to create a top-level "build" directory 
   (the directory containing the top-level "CMakeLists.txt" )
   
   then:

    MinGW Only:
      cd build
      cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
   Otherwise:
      cd build
      cmake ..
   
   (this creates Makefiles for each program and group of programs)
   
   then, to build the whole package:
   
      make

   MinGW: 
      mingw32-make
   
   All compiled programs will be written to the top-level Release/ directory.
